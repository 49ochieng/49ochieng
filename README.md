## Hi there 👋

### Want the Extra Touch?

I can also give you:

- 🖼️ A custom SVG banner with your own tagline
- 🎬 An animated self-intro GIF (you coding, coffee in hand, etc.)
- 💬 Scrollable project gallery with light/dark themes
- 🧙 A command-line-style ASCII art section

Let me know which of those you'd like next, and I’ll make them happen. We're building not just a profile—**we're creating a legend.** 🚀
